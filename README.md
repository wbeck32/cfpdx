## Beer Seeker v2.0
### TODO
* Add API endpoints to edit and update data
* Add more media queries
* Add Google Direction Service to find directions to breweries
* Google Places API to add photos or other data about the brewery? Maybe.
* Handle gracefully results that are undefined
* Cache images
* Make images a consistent size
* Add images glass types instead of just names 
* Use BreweryDB service hooks to automate updating data
* Make a crontab to automatically renew the SSL cert since it expires every 90 days.
* Get gulp autoprefixers to work
* Figure out package-lock.json - do I need one?
* Don't upload build files to the server - maybe run a script on git pull that automatically runs gulp once
